The directories part1, part2 and part3 contain skeleton code and a vivado script to help you get started in the assignment.

When beginning work on one part of the assignment:

Open Vivado and in the TCL Console:
1) change directory (cd) into one of the directories
2) run: source create_design.tcl

This will create a new project subdirectory, load in the verilog file and set up constraints. From this starting project you can modify the code, add test files and run your design through simulation.
